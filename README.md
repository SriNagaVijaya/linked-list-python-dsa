📚 Linked List-Based Data Structures in Python
This repository includes clean and modular implementations of classic Linked List Data Structures using Python. Built entirely from scratch with OOP concepts and without using Python’s built-in list, deque, or queue.

🚀 What's Inside
Data Structure	Description
🧱 Singly Linked List	Basic linear list with next pointers
🔁 Doubly Linked List	List with bidirectional navigation
🔁 Circular Singly LL	Tail connects back to head
🔁 Circular Doubly LL	Doubly list that loops back
📦 Stack (Singly LL)	LIFO structure using singly linked list
🚦 Queue (Singly LL)	FIFO structure using singly linked list
🌀 Deque (Doubly LL)	Double-ended queue using doubly linked list

✅ Features & Operations
🔹 Singly Linked List
Insert at start/end

Delete by value

Search

Display

🔹 Doubly Linked List
Insert at start/end

Delete by value

Bidirectional navigation

🔹 Circular Lists
Circular Singly: Tail points to head

Circular Doubly: Next & Prev wrap around

🔹 Stack (LIFO)
push(data)

pop()

peek()

display()

🔹 Queue (FIFO)
enqueue(data)

dequeue()

peek()

display()

🔹 Deque
add_front(data)

add_rear(data)

remove_front()

remove_rear()

display()


🧠 Learning Outcome
Understand internal workings of stacks, queues, and deques

Master pointer manipulation in linked lists

Learn OOP and class-based abstraction in Python
