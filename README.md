# 📚 Linked List-Based Data Structures in Python

This repository includes clean, modular, and beginner-friendly implementations of classic **Linked List Data Structures** using **Python**. All data structures are built entirely from scratch using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, with **no use of Python built-in `list`, `deque`, or `queue`** classes.

## 🚀 What's Inside

| Data Structure        | Description                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧱 Singly Linked List | Basic linear list with `next` pointers            |
| 🔁 Doubly Linked List | List with bidirectional navigation                |
| 🔁 Circular Singly LL | Tail connects back to the head                    |
| 🔁 Circular Doubly LL | Doubly linked list with wrap-around connections   |
| 📦 Stack (Singly LL)  | LIFO structure implemented via singly linked list |
| 🚦 Queue (Singly LL)  | FIFO structure implemented via singly linked list |
| 🌀 Deque (Doubly LL)  | Double-ended queue via doubly linked list         |

## ✅ Features & Operations

| Data Structure        | Operations                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 Singly Linked List | Insert at start/end, Delete by value, Search, Display                               |
| 🔹 Doubly Linked List | Insert at start/end, Delete by value, Navigate forward/backward, Display            |
| 🔹 Circular Lists     | Circular Singly: Tail points to head<br>Circular Doubly: Next & Prev wrap           |
| 🔹 Stack (Singly LL)  | `push(data)`, `pop()`, `peek()`, `display()`                                        |
| 🔹 Queue (Singly LL)  | `enqueue(data)`, `dequeue()`, `peek()`, `display()`                                 |
| 🔹 Deque (Doubly LL)  | `add_front(data)`, `add_rear(data)`, `remove_front()`, `remove_rear()`, `display()` |
